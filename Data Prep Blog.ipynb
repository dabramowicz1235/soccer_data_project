    "Learning new things is hard. This is not an orginal thought but, well, none of the ideas in this blog post are particularly original. I'm not writing this to show the world some brilliant insight that I developed, much as I wish such a thing existed. Instead this post's only purpose is to make it a little easier for people like me last year (knowing very little about anything) to become people like me now (still knowing very little about most things, but a little bit more about data preparation in Python using Pandas). Unfortunately, if you're coming here with *absolutely zero* experience with coding or databases then this might be a struggle, because explaining every little detail and foundational concept takes up a lot of space, and this article's already far too long as it is (probably because of run-on sentences like this one). However, if you've ever coded anything at all then I think you'll be fine, because I explain just about everything specific to this project in detail."

    "Before I continue, I’m going to stress an important point that you may have glossed over. This is about *preparing data for analysis*, not actual data science, which people seem to find more interesting. There will be no talk of correlations or statistical significance or feature selection or any of those other fun concepts. While I do have a simplistic yet functional logistic regression model who’s results are detailed at the end, I won’t talk about what they mean. In the (increasingly likely) event that I remain on the bench for an extended period of time, I hope to develop an exciting model and write a blog delving into its rationale and results. This is not that. This is basically an introduction to leveraging Pandas, a Python library made for exactly this type of analysis, and sadly not a kind of bear. Now let's get this show on the road."

    "The first step in data prep is to understand what the data will be used for. This project's goal is to predict the winner of soccer matches based on the FIFA ratings of each team’s players. Thus, we need to know the FIFA ratings of the players in a given match and said match’s result. For the unfamiliar, FIFA is a global crime syndicate that moonlights as the governing body of international soccer. Every year a video game is released called FIFA (*insert year*) that periodically rates every meaningful player in the world from a scale of 1-99. Coincidentally, there is a Kaggle dataset that contains exactly the information we need (and a whole bunch more that we don’t). This can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. I have assumed that the average FIFA rating for the players on a team is an acceptable proxy for a team’s quality; whether or not this assumption is valid is the type of question I’ll answer in the next post, should there be a next post, eventually."

For example, we can slice the dataframe to only contain the \"overall_rating\" column by putting that column's name in brackets after the dataframe of interest.

    "So, what’s the better way to do this? If you have ever written a SQL query or taken a course on databases (and managed to keep yourself awake), then you already know the answer. The best way is to take each logical entity (match or player, for example) and give it its own table. The tables interact through sharing some columns, or keys. I can then join the tables on these keys and perform operations on these combined tables. This is cleaner and this is faster. *Much* faster. Like, 25 times faster. (An analogous model took 20 seconds, and to be honest I’m surprised the gap isn’t even larger)."

If you only have enough time to finish this paragraph, then do that, because it summarizes the article. The answer lies in something called *vectorization*. Whereas the system of For Loops above forces the program to compute a function for *each individual row*, a vectorized solution allows Pandas to compute a function for *each individual dataframe*. Behind the scenes Pandas is equipped to work on arrays as one single unit, but the system of For Loops forces Pandas to treat each row of data as the foundational unit. The rest of the code will strive to faciliate vectorized solutions."

    "This is called a “list comprehension,” and this is a pretty good way of explaining it: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python. The key takeaway is that its basically a For Loop but a little bit quicker and much neater and optimized for making lists. Now that we have our column of interest I can lose the columns tracking each team's score. That means that all we're missing is a column with ID's for each match. For that we are going to cheat a bit: since each row represents a match, the row's position in the dataframe can be used as the match's unique identifier. Thus, we reset the index, which adds a column tracking each row's position, and use that as the match_id. Lastly, we rename the column headings to reflect all these changes."

Then, for each match-player pair, there are several rows (one for each time that player was rated by FIFA).

Since players have several FIFA ratings (at least one a year), the relevant rating is the one closest to when the match happened, but not after it took place (because if we ran this model on any real data, we wouldn’t know ratings that haven’t been made yet). Once we have the average rating of each team in each match, we want to know how it stacks up to its opponent. Got it? Hope so, because we're going in anyway."
