    "I’m going to be honest – I’m not really sure who this post is for. It’s going to be about how to take a dataset (specifically, one about soccer) and prepare it for analysis (specifically, a logistic regression), and that seems like a relevant enough topic. However, I’m going to be doing this prep through Python, and if you have *zero* experience with coding then it’s probably going to be a tough follow. Alternatively, if you have *too much* experience then it’s going to be boring and repetitive, despite all my attempts (read: successes) at humor. The same can probably be said for relational database systems, and SQL, and maybe also even soccer. The point is, this is for a very small, specific group of people that probably fits just me. Which I suppose is a good thing, because every successful writer has once claimed that you should not write for others, but for yourself. Guess I'm on the brink of greatness."

    "Before I continue, I’m going to stress an important point that you may have glossed over. This is about *preparing data for analysis*, not actual data science, which people seem to find more interesting. There will be no talk of correlations or statistical significance or feature selection or any of those other fun concepts. While I do have a simplistic yet functional logistic regression model who’s results are detailed at the end, I won’t talk about what they mean or place any value on them. In the (increasingly likely) event that I remain on the bench for an extended period of time, I hope to develop an exciting model and write a blog delving into its rationale and results. This is not that. This is basically an introduction to leveraging Pandas, a Python library made for exactly this type of analysis, and sadly not a bear. Now let's get this show on the road."

    "The first step in data prep is understand what the data will be used for. This project's goal is to predict the winner of soccer matches based on the FIFA ratings of each team’s players. Thus, we need to know the FIFA ratings of the players in a given match and said match’s result. For the unfamiliar, FIFA is a crime syndicate that moonlights as the governing body of international soccer. Every year a video game is released called FIFA (*insert year*) that periodically rates every meaningful player in the world from a scale of 1-99. Coincidentally, there is a Kaggle dataset that contains exactly the information we need (and a whole bunch more that we don’t). This can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. I have assumed that the average FIFA rating for the players on a team is an acceptable proxy for a team’s quality; whether or not this assumption is valid is the type of question I’ll answer in the next post, should there be a next post, eventually."

    "So, what’s the better way to do this? If you have ever written a SQL query or taken a course on databases (and managed to keep yourself awake), then you already know the answer. The best way is to take each logical entity (match or player, for example) and give it its own table. The tables interact through sharing some columns, or keys. I can then join the tables on these keys and perform operations on these combined tables. This is cleaner and this is faster. *Much* faster. Like, 25 times faster. (An analogous model took 20 seconds, and to be honest I’m surprised the gap isn’t even larger)."

If you only have enough time to finish this paragraph, then do that, because it summarizes the article. The answer lies in something called *vectorization*. Whereas the system of For Loops above forces the program to compute a function for *each individual row*, a vectorized solution allows Pandas to compute a function for *each individual dataframe*. Behind the scenes Pandas is equipped to work on arrays as one single unit, but the system of For Loops forces Pandas to treat each row of data as the foundational unit. The rest of the code will strive to faciliate vectorized solutions."

Let's start with that \"who won\" column. While the table can't yet give me a winner, it does have the score, and that’s close enough that I can make it into what I need with just one line of code: "

    "This is called a “list comprehension,” and this is a pretty good way of explaining it: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python. The key takeaway is that its basically a For Loop but a little bit quicker and much neater and optimized for making lists. Now that we have our column of interest I can lose the columns tracking each team's score. That means that all we're missing is a column with ID's for each match. For that we are going to cheat a bit: since each row represents a match, the row's position in the dataframe can be used as the match's unique identifier. Thus, we reset the index, which adds a column tracking each row's position, and use that as the match_id. Lastly, we rename the column headings into something a bit more descriptive."

The *inner level* relates to what column the data was originally in. Now each row is only described uniquely by referencing both the outer and inner levels of the index, or in English, a match-player pair!

Assuming you didn't know those things coming in, then that's pretty amazing!
